# Translate Genius Browser Extension
#### A simple Browser Extension that translates the lyrics of a song on genius.com via Google Translate

Adds a button to your browser toolbar. When clicked it opens up a popup, where you can select the language you want the lyrics to get translated to. When clicking 'Translate' the lyrics are first translated using the free Google Translate API and then put side by side next to the original text. 
<br>This helps people that are trying to learn a language to better understand, what each verse roughly means in their language of choice.
